Name: Simple Force.com App for iPad with Forward Geocoding and OAuth Support
Author: qwall@salesforce.com

What is this stuff:
This project contains a simple skeleton structure for a splitview
ipad app which uses OAuth2 and the Force.com toolkit for iOS to connect
to Force.com. 

It is primarily the same as the sample project which comes
with the toolkit save for the addition of mapping and forward geocoding to 
convert account addresses to co-ordinates and plot them on a mapview
